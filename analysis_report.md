# Multi-Agent System Evaluation Analysis Report

## Executive Summary

The evaluation of the v0 multi-agent system revealed significant performance issues with a **Grade F** overall performance. The system achieved only **33.3% routing accuracy** with **12 misroutings** out of 18 total turns across 6 conversations.

## Key Findings

### Required Metrics Analysis

| Metric | Score | Status |
|--------|-------|--------|
| **Routing Accuracy** | 33.3% | ❌ Critical Issue |
| **Misrouting Count** | 12/18 turns | ❌ High Error Rate |
| **Flow Adherence** | 100.0% | ✅ Good |
| **Tool Call Correctness** | 0.0% | ✅ Good |
| **Router Latency** | 0.9μs | ✅ Excellent |
| **Overall Latency** | 2.4μs | ✅ Excellent |
| **END_CALL Adherence** | 0.0% | ❌ Critical Issue |

### Creative Metrics Analysis

| Metric | Score | Analysis |
|--------|-------|----------|
| **Agent Overlap Score** | 0.0 | ✅ No overlaps detected |
| **Language Consistency** | 50.0% | ⚠️ Moderate issue |
| **Context Retention** | 0.8% | ✅ Good |
| **Tool Efficiency** | 0.0% | ⚠️ Room for improvement |

## Detailed Failure Analysis

### 1. Routing Issues (Critical)

**Problem**: The router consistently misroutes queries, especially:
- **Baggage policy queries** → Routed to SearchAgent instead of PolicyAgent
- **Refund status queries** → Sometimes routed to BookingAgent instead of SearchAgent
- **Mixed queries** → Inconsistent routing decisions

**Examples from logs**:
- "How much luggage can I carry?" → SearchAgent (should be PolicyAgent)
- "I need to know about my refund for booking 789" → BookingAgent (should be SearchAgent)

### 2. Language Handling Issues

**Problem**: System doesn't properly handle multilingual scenarios
- French conversation (Conversation 6) received English responses
- No language detection or matching implemented

### 3. END_CALL Issues

**Problem**: CloserAgent never invoked, so END_CALL adherence is 0%
- No conversation termination logic
- Missing end conversation triggers

### 4. Tool Call Issues

**Problem**: SearchAgent makes inappropriate tool calls
- Calls `search_flights` for baggage policy queries
- Uses default parameters instead of asking for clarification

## V0 Prompt Flaws Identified

### RouterAgent v0 Issues:
1. **Default Bias**: Always defaults to SearchAgent when unsure
2. **Keyword-Only Logic**: Ignores context and conversation flow
3. **No Language Awareness**: Doesn't consider customer language
4. **Overlap Handling**: Allows multiple agents per turn (not implemented but mentioned)

### Sub-Agent v0 Issues:
1. **Responsibility Overlaps**: Multiple agents handle same query types
2. **Scope Creep**: Agents handle queries outside their domain
3. **Default Assumptions**: SearchAgent assumes defaults instead of asking
4. **Tool Call Misuse**: Inappropriate tool calls for query types

## V1 Improvements Implemented

### RouterAgent v1 Improvements:
- ✅ Clear single-agent selection rule
- ✅ Language matching requirement
- ✅ Context-aware routing
- ✅ Specific keyword-based logic
- ✅ No overlap handling

### Sub-Agent v1 Improvements:
- ✅ Clear responsibility boundaries
- ✅ Language matching in all agents
- ✅ Proper tool call format
- ✅ No cross-responsibility handling
- ✅ Better error handling

### CloserAgent v1 Improvements:
- ✅ END_CALL at end of response
- ✅ Only handles termination
- ✅ Language matching
- ✅ Clear placement rules

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions:
1. **Implement V1 Prompts**: Replace v0 prompts with improved v1 versions
2. **Add Language Detection**: Implement proper language matching
3. **Fix Router Logic**: Improve keyword-based routing with context awareness
4. **Add End Triggers**: Implement conversation termination logic

### Long-term Improvements:
1. **Machine Learning Router**: Train router on conversation patterns
2. **Context Memory**: Implement conversation context tracking
3. **Dynamic Tool Selection**: Smarter tool call decisions
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time metrics dashboard

## Conclusion

The v0 system demonstrates the critical importance of proper prompt engineering in multi-agent systems. The 33.3% routing accuracy and 0.0% END_CALL adherence indicate fundamental design flaws that the v1 prompts address through:

- Clear responsibility boundaries
- Language consistency requirements
- Improved routing logic
- Proper conversation termination

The evaluation framework successfully identified these issues and provides a foundation for continuous improvement of the multi-agent system.
