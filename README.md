# Multi-Agent System Evaluation Tool

## DS Intern Challenge - 90-Minute Test

### 🎯 **Project Overview**

This project implements a comprehensive evaluation framework for a multi-agent customer service system. The goal is to evaluate flawed v0 prompts, identify their failures, and propose improved v1 prompts that address these issues.

**Why This Approach?** The task requires critical thinking about prompt engineering - not just building a system, but understanding WHY prompts fail and HOW to fix them.

---

## 🏗️ **System Architecture & Reasoning**

### **Why Multi-Agent Architecture?**

The task simulates a real-world customer service system where:
- **RouterAgent** decides which specialist should handle each query
- **Specialist Agents** handle specific domains (flights, policies, complaints, etc.)
- **Customer Simulator** generates realistic queries to test the system

**Reasoning**: This mirrors how actual customer service works - routing queries to the right department/specialist.

### **Agent Responsibilities (v0 - Intentionally Flawed)**

| Agent | Responsibility | Why This Design? |
|-------|---------------|------------------|
| **RouterAgent** | Routes queries to sub-agents | Central decision point - where most failures occur |
| **SearchAgent** | Flight searches, refund status | Common customer queries |
| **PolicyAgent** | Baggage rules, policies | Policy queries need specific knowledge |
| **ComplaintAgent** | Complaints, damage reports | Requires empathy and escalation |
| **BookingAgent** | Booking details, confirmations | Transactional queries |
| **CloserAgent** | Conversation termination | Proper conversation closure |

**Why These Agents?** They represent the most common customer service scenarios in airline industry.

## 🔍 **Evaluation Methodology & Reasoning**

### **Why Random Conversations?**

**Reasoning**: Real customer service is unpredictable. Fixed conversations would only test specific scenarios, but we need to see how the system handles:
- Different query types
- Various conversation lengths
- Unexpected combinations
- Edge cases

**Implementation**: `CustomerSimulator` generates 4-6 random conversations with 3-6 turns each, covering all agent domains.

### **Why These Specific Metrics?**

#### **Required Metrics (Task Mandated)**
1. **Routing Accuracy**: % of queries routed to correct agent
   - **Why**: Core functionality - wrong routing = wrong responses
2. **Misrouting Count**: Number of incorrect routing decisions
   - **Why**: Quantifies the severity of routing problems
3. **Flow Adherence**: Proper conversation flow
   - **Why**: Conversations should follow logical patterns
4. **Tool Call Correctness**: Valid tool usage
   - **Why**: Agents must use tools correctly to function
5. **Router Latency**: Time to make routing decisions
   - **Why**: Performance matters in real systems
6. **Overall Latency**: Total response time
   - **Why**: User experience depends on response speed
7. **END_CALL Adherence**: Proper conversation termination
   - **Why**: Conversations must end cleanly

#### **Creative Metrics (Invented)**
1. **Agent Overlap Score**: Measures responsibility conflicts
   - **Why**: Multiple agents handling same query = confusion
2. **Language Consistency Score**: Tracks language matching
   - **Why**: Global customer service needs multilingual support
3. **Context Retention Score**: Conversation memory
   - **Why**: Good conversations build on previous context
4. **Tool Efficiency Score**: Optimal tool usage
   - **Why**: Over/under-using tools indicates poor design

**Why These Creative Metrics?** They measure aspects that standard metrics miss but are crucial for real-world systems.

## 🚨 **V0 Prompt Flaws & Why They Exist**

### **Intentional Design Flaws (As Per Task)**

The v0 prompts are **intentionally flawed** to test your analytical skills:

#### **1. RouterAgent v0 Flaws**
```python
# FLAWED: Defaults to SearchAgent when unsure
if unsure:
    return "SearchAgent"  # WRONG

# FLAWED: Allows multiple agents per turn
"You may let two agents handle the same turn if both are relevant"

# FLAWED: Ignores language
"Language doesn't matter — pick based on keywords only"
```

**Why These Flaws?** They represent common mistakes in prompt engineering:
- Default bias
- Unclear boundaries
- Ignoring context

#### **2. Sub-Agent v0 Flaws**
```python
# FLAWED: SearchAgent handles policies
if "baggage" in message:
    return "SearchAgent"  # Should be PolicyAgent

# FLAWED: Assumes defaults
"Assume defaults (economy, today's date)"

# FLAWED: Multiple tool calls
"Multiple tool calls per turn are okay"
```

**Why These Flaws?** They show:
- Responsibility overlaps
- Poor user experience
- Inefficient resource usage

## 📊 **Expected Results & What They Mean**

### **V0 Performance (Consistently Poor)**
- **Routing Accuracy**: 50-61% (should be >80%)
- **Performance Grade**: F or D (should be A or B)
- **END_CALL Adherence**: 0% (should be 100%)
- **Language Consistency**: 50% (should be >90%)

**Why These Results?** They prove the v0 prompts are fundamentally flawed, which is exactly what the task wants to demonstrate.

### **What Good Results Look Like**
- **Routing Accuracy**: >80% (most queries routed correctly)
- **Performance Grade**: A or B (system works well)
- **END_CALL Adherence**: 100% (conversations end properly)
- **Language Consistency**: >90% (multilingual support works)

---

## 🔧 **V1 Improvements & Reasoning**

### **Why V1 Prompts Are Better**

#### **1. Clear Agent Boundaries**
```python
# V0: Vague responsibilities
"Handles flight searches, refund status, and sometimes refund policies"

# V1: Clear boundaries
"Handles flight searches, refund status queries, and availability checks ONLY"
```

**Reasoning**: Clear boundaries prevent responsibility overlaps and confusion.

#### **2. Language Matching**
```python
# V0: Ignores language
"Language doesn't matter"

# V1: Matches customer language
"Always respond in the customer's language"
```

**Reasoning**: Global customer service requires multilingual support.

#### **3. Proper Tool Usage**
```python
# V0: Multiple tool calls allowed
"Multiple tool calls per turn are okay"

# V1: One tool call per turn
"Use <CALL_TOOL=action>{"param":"value"} format, ONE per turn maximum"
```

**Reasoning**: Efficient resource usage and clearer agent behavior.

## 🚀 **How to Use the System**

### **Quick Start**
```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run evaluation (single command)
python main.py
```

### **What Happens When You Run It**

1. **Conversation Generation**: Creates 6 random conversations with 3-6 turns each
2. **Agent Routing**: RouterAgent decides which sub-agent handles each query
3. **Response Generation**: Sub-agents respond with appropriate tools
4. **Metrics Calculation**: System calculates all required and creative metrics
5. **Report Generation**: Creates comprehensive analysis reports

### **Output Files Generated**

| File | Purpose | Why This Format? |
|------|---------|------------------|
| `evaluation_report.json` | Raw data and metrics | Machine-readable for analysis |
| `analysis_report.md` | High-level analysis | Human-readable summary |
| `V0_FAILURE_ANALYSIS.md` | Detailed failure breakdown | Technical deep dive |
| `DELIVERABLES_SUMMARY.md` | Task completion checklist | Submission verification |
