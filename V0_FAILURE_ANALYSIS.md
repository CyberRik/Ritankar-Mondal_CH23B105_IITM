## üîç **Detailed Failure Analysis**

### **1. Routing Accuracy Failures (50% - Critical)**

#### **Problem: Keyword-Only Logic**
**V0 Router Logic:**
```python
# Flawed approach - keyword matching only
if any(word in message_lower for word in ["search", "find", "flight"]):
    return "SearchAgent"
```

**Failure Examples:**
- **"How much luggage can I carry?"** ‚Üí Routed to SearchAgent (should be PolicyAgent)
- **"What are the baggage rules for international flights?"** ‚Üí Routed to SearchAgent (should be PolicyAgent)
- **"I need to know about my refund for booking 789"** ‚Üí Routed to BookingAgent (should be SearchAgent)

**Why It Fails:**
- No context awareness
- Ignores conversation history
- Defaults to SearchAgent when unsure
- No understanding of query intent

#### **Problem: Default Bias**
**V0 Rule:**
> "Always output one sub-agent, but if unsure, pick SearchAgent by default."

**Impact:**
- 9 out of 18 turns misrouted
- SearchAgent handles 67% of all queries (overloaded)
- Other agents underutilized

### **2. END_CALL Adherence Failures (0% - Critical)**

#### **Problem: No End Conversation Triggers**
**V0 Router Logic:**
```python
# Only triggers on specific words
if any(word in message_lower for word in ["bye", "goodbye", "end", "close", "finish"]):
    return "CloserAgent"
```

**Why It Fails:**
- Customer simulator never generates end messages
- No automatic conversation termination
- Conversations end abruptly without proper closure
- No <END_CALL> tags ever placed

**V0 Prompt Ambiguity:**
> "If the user ends, you can either pick CloserAgent or just end the chat directly."

This creates confusion about when to use CloserAgent.

### **3. Language Consistency Failures (50% - High)**

#### **Problem: No Language Detection**
**V0 Router Rule:**
> "Language doesn't matter ‚Äî pick based on keywords only."

**Failure Examples:**
- **French conversation** (Conversation 6) received English responses
- No language matching between customer and agent
- Multilingual scenarios fail completely

**Impact:**
- Poor user experience for non-English speakers
- Breaks international customer service requirements

### **4. Tool Call Misuse (Moderate)**

#### **Problem: Inappropriate Tool Calls**
**SearchAgent V0 Behavior:**
```python
# Calls search_flights for baggage policy queries
if "baggage" in message_lower:
    tool_calls.append({
        "action": "search_flights",  # WRONG TOOL
        "params": {"origin": "BLR", "destination": "DEL"}
    })
```

**Why It Fails:**
- SearchAgent calls flight search tools for policy queries
- Assumes default parameters instead of asking for clarification
- Tool calls don't match query intent

### **5. Context Retention Issues (67% - Moderate)**

#### **Problem: No Conversation Memory**
**V0 Agent Behavior:**
- Each turn treated independently
- No reference to previous conversation context
- No customer preference tracking
- No conversation history consideration

**Impact:**
- Repetitive responses
- Poor user experience
- Missed opportunities for personalization

## üö® **Critical Failure Patterns**

### **Pattern 1: Responsibility Overlaps**
**V0 Problem:**
> "You may let two agents handle the same turn if both are relevant."

**Examples:**
- Refund queries handled by both SearchAgent and PolicyAgent
- Booking queries handled by both BookingAgent and SearchAgent
- Policy queries handled by both PolicyAgent and SearchAgent

**Impact:**
- Confusing responses
- Duplicate information
- Poor user experience

### **Pattern 2: Scope Creep**
**V0 Problem:**
Agents handle queries outside their domain.

**Examples:**
- SearchAgent handles policy queries
- PolicyAgent handles booking queries
- BookingAgent handles availability queries

**Impact:**
- Inconsistent responses
- Wrong information provided
- System confusion

### **Pattern 3: Default Assumptions**
**V0 Problem:**
> "If missing details, assume defaults (economy, today's date)."

**Examples:**
- Flight searches assume BLR‚ÜíDEL route
- Assumes today's date instead of asking
- Assumes economy class without confirmation

**Impact:**
- Wrong search results
- Poor user experience
- Wasted time and resources

---

## üîß **Root Cause Analysis**

### **1. Prompt Engineering Issues**
- **Vague Instructions**: "If unsure, pick SearchAgent"
- **Ambiguous Rules**: "You may let two agents handle the same turn"
- **Missing Context**: No conversation history consideration
- **No Language Handling**: "Language doesn't matter"

### **2. System Design Flaws**
- **No End Detection**: Conversations don't terminate properly
- **No Context Memory**: Each turn treated independently
- **No Language Detection**: Multilingual support missing
- **No Tool Validation**: Inappropriate tool calls allowed

### **3. Evaluation Gaps**
- **No Conversation Termination**: Customer simulator doesn't generate end messages
- **Limited Scenarios**: Missing edge cases and error conditions
- **No Multilingual Testing**: Limited language coverage

---

## üìà **Impact Assessment**

### **User Experience Impact**
- **50% of queries** routed to wrong agents
- **0% proper conversation termination**
- **50% language mismatches** in multilingual scenarios
- **Poor context retention** across conversation turns

### **System Performance Impact**
- **Inefficient routing** leads to wrong responses
- **Tool misuse** wastes computational resources
- **No conversation closure** creates incomplete interactions
- **Language mismatches** break international support

### **Business Impact**
- **Poor customer satisfaction** due to wrong responses
- **Increased support costs** from confused customers
- **Lost international customers** due to language issues
- **Inefficient operations** from misrouted queries

---

## üéØ **V1 Solutions Address These Failures**

### **1. Clear Agent Boundaries**
```python
# V1: Clear responsibilities
SearchAgent: Only flight searches and refund status
PolicyAgent: Only policies and rules
ComplaintAgent: Only complaints and issues
BookingAgent: Only booking details and confirmations
CloserAgent: Only conversation termination
```

### **2. Improved Routing Logic**
```python
# V1: Context-aware routing
if "baggage" in message and "policy" in context:
    return "PolicyAgent"  # Not SearchAgent
```

### **3. Language Matching**
```python
# V1: Language detection and matching
if customer_language != "english":
    respond_in_customer_language = True
```

### **4. Proper Conversation Termination**
```python
# V1: Clear end detection
if conversation_complete or customer_wants_to_end:
    return "CloserAgent"
```

## üèÜ **Conclusion**

The v0 prompts fail due to **fundamental design flaws** in prompt engineering:

1. **Vague and ambiguous instructions**
2. **No context awareness**
3. **Missing language support**
4. **Poor conversation flow management**
5. **Inappropriate tool usage**

These failures result in a **Grade F performance** with critical issues in routing accuracy, conversation termination, and multilingual support. The v1 prompts address these issues through clear boundaries, context awareness, and proper conversation management.

**The evaluation successfully identified these failures and provided comprehensive solutions in v1 prompts.**
